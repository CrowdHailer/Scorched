Light-weight, DRY as a desert, web framework for Ruby. Inspired by Sinatra, this framework is the next evolutionary step in light-weight ruby web frameworks, picking up where the others left off.

Majority of core API design and implemention planning are complete. Currently implementing the frameworks core. First commit to github will come once core functionality is complete and useable (v0.1).
